## Prediction of Heart Failures
---

In collaboration with Bharti Sanjeebkumar Sinha, I implemented a data science project aimed at predicting the survival of patients with history of heart failures,
during their follow up period.

#### Instructions
---

1. 'Data Retriving' is to be run first to correctly import file into the workspace and check if its similar to the source.
The functions under this part takes care of data retriving part.

2. Secondly, 'Data Preparation' is to be executed to check if all the columns in the data has right format and is free from errors.
Outliers have been handled in this part of the script file. 

3. Afterwards, 'Data exploration' checks the composition, trends and statistical distribution of the columns.
Various kinds of plots such as line, bar and pie have been leveraged to explore pattern in the data.

4. Lastly, 'Data Modelling' fits two classification models, KNN and Decision Tree to the clean data.
Various versions of the models have been used for training to see which better learns the patterns in the data. Model scoring in Knn is done in various versions, with 7fold cross validation with 3 nearest neighbour giving the best results with 95% accuracy..
 

The report file is located in the base directory with "report.pdf" which contains the result and conclusion of the modelling process.
